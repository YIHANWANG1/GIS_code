# Project: World Inequality Difference Analysis

This project provides an analysis of inequality differences across countries from 2010 to 2019. The compiled dataset and code are included for reference and further study.

## Files

- **world_inequalityDifference.geojson**  
  This file contains the merged dataset with geographical data, allowing visualization of inequality index changes for each country between 2010 and 2019. The data is in GeoJSON format, making it compatible with most GIS and data visualization tools.

- **homework.R**  
  This R script compiles the data and generates the `world_inequalityDifference.geojson` file. It includes data preprocessing, merging, and calculation functions for inequality differences.

## Usage

1. **Viewing Data**: Load `world_inequalityDifference.geojson` into a GIS software or a mapping library in R (such as `sf` or `leaflet`) to visualize inequality changes across countries.

2. **Running the Code**: Open `homework.R` in an R environment and execute to reproduce the merged dataset or to customize analysis parameters.
